# iBeacon Ranger

by [Christopher Stevens](http://www.christopherstevens.cc)

##What Is It?
iBeacon Ranger is an iBeacon diagnostic tool for iOS and Android built with PhoneGap/Adobe PhoneGap Build. Based on [this cool guy's awesome beacon plugin here], range and monitor a specified set of iBeacons in realtime (currently must set iBeacons to be monitored in js/index.js). This app serves as an example of how to utilize [this cool beacon plugin] and as a starting point for creating your own PhoneGap iBeacon app.
